Zoo Animals Listing iterator pattern
====================================

An implementation of the iterator pattern as applied to collections of zoo animals.  The AnimalGroup interface is implemented in two classes: the Otters and the Kangaroos classes.  These classes handle the creation of new Animal objects which are then stored in a collection.  The Kangaroos class uses an array, the Otters class uses a LinkedList and the PolarBears uses a HashMap.  The java.util.Iterator interface is implemented by the KangarooIterator, OtterIterator and PolarBearIterator classes.  This provides the necessary common interface for iteration over the respective classes collections.  Each iterator class implements the necessary steps for iterating over the collections.  The AnimalListing class handles creation of the Kangaroos, Otters and PolarBears classes, adds the necessary animals and then lists the animals using the iterator classes.  In this way the AnimalListing class is dependent on two interfaces, not on any concrete classes or objects.  This is basic practice with the iterator pattern.
